# python-practice
This folder contains my foundational Python practice work. The pythonchallenges.py file is a running collection of beginner-level exercises focused on core concepts like:

Variables, strings, and input/output
Lists, slicing, and indexing
Conditionals and loops
Functions

These challenges are part of my broader upskilling roadmap toward cloud and AI engineering roles. As I progress, Iâ€™ll break out topics into dedicated files and folders (e.g., functions/, loops/, file_io/) for better organization and reuse.

ðŸ“Œ This repo is a living workspace. Expect frequent updates as I build toward real-world automation and cloud-integrated projects.
